Using the data I have discovered during this project, it is evident that
1. Urban areas far exceed other areas of living for app ordered taxis and car service.
2. The amount of drivers in urban areas greatly exceed that of other areas.
3. The price for rides in the lesser end groups, suburban and rural, prices tend to be higher than that of urban areas.
